# Stock-price-Project
This project aims to forecast stock prices using machine learning techniques. The model is trained using historical stock data and predicts whether the stock price will go up or down on a given day. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Yahoo Finance. It contains historical stock prices for a specified ticker.
The classification report and bar graph provide insights into the model's performance, including precision, recall, f1-score, and overall accuracy.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices. The trained model predicts whether the stock price will go up or down based on historical data and engineered features.
